# Foreword

The Road to learn React teaches the fundamentals of React. You will build a real-world application in plain React without complicated tooling. Everything from project setup to deployment on a server will be explained for you. The book comes with additional referenced reading material and exercises with each chapter. After reading the book, you will be able to build your own applications in React. The material is kept up to date by myself and the community.

In the Road to learn React, I offer a foundation before you dive into the broader React ecosystem. The concepts will have less tooling and less external state management, but a lot of information about React. It explains general concepts, patterns, and best practices in a real world React application.

Essentially, you will learn to build your own React application from scratch, with features like pagination, client-side caching, and interactions like searching and sorting. Additionally, you will transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6. I hope this book captures my enthusiasm for React and JavaScript, and that it helps you get started with it.

## About the Author

I am a German software and web engineer dedicated to learning and teaching programming in JavaScript. After obtaining my Master's Degree in computer science, I continued learning on my own. I gained experience from the startup world, where I used JavaScript intensively during both my professional life and spare time, which eventually led to a desire to teach others about these topics.

For a few years, I worked closely with an exceptional team of engineers at a company called Small Improvements, developing large scale applications. The company offered a SaaS product that enables customers to give feedback to businesses. This application was developed using JavaScript on its frontend, and Java as its backend. The first iteration of Small Improvements' frontend was written in Java with the Wicket Framework and jQuery. When the first generation of SPAs became popular, the company migrated to Angular 1.x for its frontend application. After using Angular for over two years, it became clear that Angular wasn't the best solution to work with state intense applications, so they made the jump to React and Redux. This enabled it to operate on a large scale successfully.

During my time in the company, I regularly wrote articles about web development on my website. I received great feedback from people learning from my articles which allowed me to improve my writing and teaching style. Article after article, I grew my ability to teach others. I felt that my first articles were packed with too much information, quite overwhelming for students, but I improved by focusing on one subject at a time.

Currently, I am a self-employed software engineer and educator. I find it a fulfilling pastime to see students thrive by giving them clear objectives and short feedback loops.

## Education for Children

The book should enable everyone to learn React. However, not everyone has access to the required resources, because not everyone is educated in the English language. I want to use this project to support other projects that teach children English in the developing world.

## FAQ

**How to get updates?**

I have two channels where I share updates about my content. You can [subscribe to updates by email](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). Regardless of the channel, my objective is to only share quality content. Once you receive notification the book has changed, you can download a new version of it.

**Does it use the recent React version?**

The book always receives an update when the React version is updated. Programming books are usually outdated soon after their release, but since this book is self-published, I can update it as needed.

**Does it cover Redux?**

It doesn't, so I have written a second book. The Road to learn React should give you a solid foundation before you dive into advanced topics. The implementation of the sample application in the book will show that you don't need Redux to build an application in React. After you have read the book, you should be able to implement a solid application without Redux. Then you can read my second book, Taming the State in React, to learn Redux.

**Does it use JavaScript ES6?**

Yes. Don't worry, though, you will be fine if you are familiar with JavaScript ES5. All JavaScript ES6 features, that I describe in The Journey to Learn React, will transition from ES5 to ES6. The book does not only teach React, but also all useful JavaScript ES6 features.

**How to get access to the source code projects and screencasts series?**

If you bought one of the extended packages that grant access to the source code projects, screencast series or any other add-on, you should find these on your [course dashboard](https://roadtoreact.com/my-courses). If you bought the course other than [the official Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com) course platform, create an account on the platform, and then go to the Admin page and contact me with one of the email templates. After that I can enroll you in the course. If you haven't bought one of the extended packages, you can reach out any time to upgrade your content to access the source code projects and screencast series.

**Can I get a copy of the book if I bought it on Amazon?**

If you have bought the book on Amazon, you may have seen that the book is available on my website too. Since I use Amazon as one way to monetize my often free content, I honestly thank you for your support and invite you to sign up on [Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com). There you can write me an email (Admin page) about your purchase, so that I can unlock the whole course package for you. In addition, you can always download the latest ebook version of the book on the platform.

**How can I get help while reading the book?**

The book has a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for people who are reading along. You can join the channel to get help, or to help others, as helping others may help you internalize your own understanding. If there is no one available to help you, you can always reach out to me.

**Is there any troubleshoot area?**

If you run into problems, please join the Slack Group. Also, check the [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react/issues) or in the GitHub repositories of the applications you will build along the way to see if any solutions are listed for specific issue. If your problem wasn't mentioned, open a new issue where you can explain your problem, provide a screenshot, and offer more details (e.g. book page, node version).

**Can I help to improve the content?**

Yes, I love to hear feedback. Simply open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react). These can be technical improvements, or clarification on the discussed topics. You can open pull requests on the GitHub page as well.

**Is there a money back guarantee?**

Yes, there is 100% money back guarantee for two months if you don't think it's a good fit. Please reach out to me to get a refund.

**How to support the project?**

If you find my lessons useful and would like to contribute, seek my website's [About Page](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/) for information about how to offer support. It is also very helpful for my readers spread the word about how my books helped them, so others might discover ways to improve their web development skillsets. Contributing through any of the provided channels gives me the freedom to create in-depth courses, and to continue offering free material.

**What's your motivation behind the book?**

I want to teach about this topic consistently. I often find materials online that don't receive update, or only applies to a small part of a topic. Sometimes people struggle to find consistent and up-to-date resources to learn from. I want to provide this consistent and up-to-date learning experience. Also, I hope I can support the less fortunate with my projects by giving them the content for free or by [having other impacts](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/). Recently I've found myself fulfilled when teaching others about programming, as it's a meaningful activity I prefer over any 9 to 5 job at any company. I hope to continue this path in the future.

## Challenge

Personally I write a lot about my learnings. That's how I got where I am right now. You are teaching a topic at its best when you have just learned about it yourself. Since teaching helped me a lot in my career, I want you to experience the same effects of it. But first you have to do the cause: teaching yourself. My challenge for the book is the following: teach others what you are learning while reading the book. A couple of breakpoints on how you could achieve it:

* Write a blog post about a specific topic from the book. It's not about copying and pasting the material but rather about teaching the topic your own way. Find your own words to explain something, grab a problem and solve it, and dive even more into the topic by understanding every detail about it. Then teach it to others in this one article. You will see how it fills your knowledge gaps, because you have to dig deeper into the topic, and how it opens doors for your career in the long term.

* If you are active on social media, grab a couple of things you have learned while reading the book and share them with your friends. For instance, you can tweet a hot tip on Twitter about your last learning from the book which may be interesting for others too. Just take a screenshot of the passage of the book or even better: write about it in your own words. That's how you can get into teaching without investing much time.

* If you feel confident recording your learning adventure, share your way through the book on Facebook Live, YouTube Live or Twitch. It helps you to stay concentrated and work your way through the book. Even though you don't have many people following your live session, you can always use the video to put it on YouTube afterward. Besides it is a great way to verbalize your problems and how you are going to solve them.

I would love to see people doing especially the last breakpoint: record yourself while reading this book, implementing the application(s), and conducting the exercises, and put the final version on YouTube. If parts in between of the recording are taking longer, just cut the video or use a timelapse effect for them. If you get stuck and need to fix a bug, don't leave it out but rather include these passages in the video, because they are so valuable for your audience which may run into the same issues. I believe it is important to have these parts in your video. A couple of tips for the video:

* Do it in your native language or in English if you feel comfortable with it.

* Verbalize your thoughts, the things you are doing or the problems you are running into. Having a visual video is only one part of the challenge, but the other part is you narrating through the implementation. It doesn't have to be perfect. Instead it should feel natural and not polished as all the other video courses online where nobody runs into problems.

* If you run into bugs, embrace the trouble. Try to fix the problem yourself and search online for help, don't give up, and speak about the problem and how you attempt to solve it. This helps others to follow your thought process. As I said before, it has no value to follow polished video courses online where the instructor never runs into problems. It's the most valuable part to see someone else fixing a bug in the source code.

* Some words about the technical side of the recording: Check your audio before you record a longer video. It should have the correct volume and the quality should be alright too. Regarding your editor/IDE/terminal, make sure to increase the font size. Maybe it is possible to place the code and the browser side by side. If not, make them fullscreen and switch between (e.g. MacOS CMD + Tab).

* Edit the video yourself before you put it on YouTube. It doesn't have to be a high quality, but you should try to keep it concise for your audience (e.g. leaving out the reading passages and rather summarize the steps in your own words).

In the end, you can reach out to me for promoting anything you have released. For instance, if the video turns out well, I would love to include it in this book as officially supplementary material. Just reach out to me once you finished it. After all, I hope you accept this challenge to enhance your learning experience while reading the book which also may help others. I wish you all the best for it.
